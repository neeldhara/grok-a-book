#### Background

üëãüèΩ Let's work through books together!

This website serves to catalog records of meetings organized around book reading exercises. The typical plan is simple:

- pick a book to grok
- identify a ~month-long window and make a reading plan
- meet every day at a fixed time over Zoom (the default is 9PM IST)

The meetings are recorded and if there is any material that went into prep (slides and/or notes), they will be posted here along with the recordings. There will be, in any case, a placeholder page for each session with a comment box thrown in, so we can have asynchronous discussions. 

We alternate between [textbook-ish material](texts.qmd) and [non-fiction reads](non-fiction.qmd).

Do you have any suggestions/ideas? Drop a comment below!
