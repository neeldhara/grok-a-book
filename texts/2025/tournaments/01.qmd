We talked about:

- round robin vs knockout tournaments
- the notion of tournament solutions 
- when two tournaments are isomorphic 

Exercises:

- explicitly enumerate all labeled tournaments on 3 and 4 vertices
- show that self-complementary cyclic tournaments on $n$ vertices exist if and only if $n$ is odd
