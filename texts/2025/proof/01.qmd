We spent some time on variations of the proof of the fact that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. Some things that came up:

- The least number principle vs axiom of choice: are these independent? 
- While working through a critique of an incorrect proof showing that $\sqrt{n}$ is irrational for all $n$, we showed that $\sqrt{n}$ is rational iff $n = m^2$ for some $m$.
- We went over a nice geometric proof of the irrationality of $\sqrt{2}$ and translated it to algebraic terms. 

Up next: exercises!
