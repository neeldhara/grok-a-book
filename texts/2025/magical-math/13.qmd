Perfect shuffles are a fascinating concept in both mathematics and card magic. There are two main types of perfect shuffles:

1. **In-Shuffle**: The top and bottom halves of the deck are perfectly interleaved, with the first card from the bottom half becoming the top card of the shuffled deck.

2. **Out-Shuffle**: The top and bottom halves of the deck are perfectly interleaved, with the first card from the top half remaining the top card of the shuffled deck.

The interactive demonstration below shows how these two types of perfect shuffles work with a deck of 20 cards. The top row (1-10) is shown in light red, and the bottom row (11-20) is shown in light blue.

- Click the **In-Shuffle** button to perform an in-shuffle
- Click the **Out-Shuffle** button to perform an out-shuffle
- Click the **Split Deck** button to separate the cards back into two rows

#### Mathematical Properties

Perfect shuffles have interesting mathematical properties:

- With a standard 52-card deck, 8 consecutive out-shuffles will return the deck to its original order.
- With a 2n-card deck, the number of out-shuffles needed to restore the original order is related to the order of 2 modulo (2n-1).
- In-shuffles and out-shuffles can be represented as permutations, making them useful for studying group theory.

Perfect shuffles are widely used in card magic because of their predictable patterns and the ability to control the position of specific cards in the deck.

### Monge and Milk Shuffles

The Monge shuffle (also called the over/under shuffle) and the Milk shuffle (also known as the Klondike shuffle) are two other interesting shuffling techniques with mathematical properties.

#### Monge Shuffle

In a Monge shuffle, cards are placed alternately on top and bottom of the pile:
- The top card is taken and held in the other hand
- The next card is placed above it
- The third card is placed below the first two
- This pattern continues, alternating between placing cards on top and bottom

#### Milk (Klondike) Shuffle

The Milk shuffle involves taking pairs of cards from the top and bottom of the deck:
- Take the top card, then the bottom card
- Place them together on a new pile
- Continue this process until all cards are in the new pile

The demonstration below shows how these shuffles work with a deck of 20 cards. The cards are color-coded to help visualize the pattern of movement.

#### Interesting Properties

- The Monge and Milk shuffles are inverses of each other. Performing a Milk shuffle followed by a Monge shuffle (or vice versa) returns the deck to its original order.
- Both shuffles have predictable cycle lengths depending on the number of cards in the deck.
- These shuffles are useful in card magic for controlling the positions of specific cards.
